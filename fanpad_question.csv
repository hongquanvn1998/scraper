The strength of FANPAD is that they have a team of enthusiastic CMs and admins, in addition, their mechanism is also very interesting, the tier mechanism is also very nice and user-friendly, the weakness is that the time to TGE is quite long. , users have to wait a long time, but we understand that due to market reasons and careful preparation, we hope you will bring a really quality project.
The FANPAD IDO reward and participation mechanism that I see on the docs is really interesting, it helps users feel more fair and transparent in FANPAD's decisions and events that users participate in.
Which project will be launched first?
